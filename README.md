#Fork Tips#

Goal: make a recipe site that is the best for cooks in the kitchen

Problem: Current recipe sites follow the same format as printed recipes. A list of ingredients and a list of steps. This requires lots of cross-referencing. With tiny fonts and lots of ads crowding the space it also involves lots of squinting.


First version goals:
1. Make a recipe page
2. Each recipe has ingredients, steps, and a photo
3. Each step has all of the information the cook needs to complete that step
4. The ingredients in each step will include the amounts
5. Ingredients in steps can be faded/unfaded by clicking on them. This is to help cooks keep track of additions
6. The selected step will have "focus" and the others will be slightly faded

Sort-term goals
1. Make a home page for browsing and sorting recipes
2. Include related recipes for each recipe
3. Add ratings for recipes
 
Long-term goals:
1. Recipes can be forked by authors to create variations.
